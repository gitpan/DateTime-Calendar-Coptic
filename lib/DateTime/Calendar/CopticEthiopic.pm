=head1 NAME

DateTime::Calendar::CopticEthiopic - DateTime Module for the Coptic/Ethiopic Calendar System.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use DateTime::Calendar::CopticEthiopic;
 #
 #  typical instantiation:
 #
 my $ethio = new DateTime::Calendar::CopticEthiopic ( day => 29, month => 6, year => 1995 );
 $ethio    = new DateTime::Calendar::CopticEthiopic ( ical => '19950629' );  # the same

 #
 # Get Gregorian Date:
 #
 my ($d,$m,$y) = $ethio->gregorian;

 #
 #  instantiate with a Gregorian date, date will be converted.
 #
 $ethio = new DateTime::Calendar::CopticEthiopic ( ical => '20030308', calscale => 'gregorian' );

 #
 #  instantiate with a DateTime::ICal object, assumed to be in Gregorian
 #
 my $grego = new DateTime::ICal ( ical => '20030308' );
 $ethio = new DateTime::Calendar::CopticEthiopic ( $grego );

 #
 #  get a DateTime::ICal object in the Gregorian calendar system
 #
 $grego = $ethio->toGregorian;  


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The DateTime::Calendar::CopticEthiopic module provides a base class for
DateTime::Calendar::Coptic and DateTime::Calendar::Ethiopic and handles
conversions to and from the Gregorian calendar system.

=head2 Limitations

In the Gregorian system the rule for adding a 29th day to February during
leap year follows as per;  February will have a 29th day:

(((((every 4 years) except every 100 years) except every 400 years) except every 2,000) except (maybe every 16,000 years))

The Coptic/Ethiopic calendar gets an extra day at the end of the 13th month on leap
year (which occurs the year before Gregorian leap year).
It is not known however if the Coptic/Ethiopic calendar follows the 2,000 year rule.
If it does NOT follow the 2,000 year rule the consequence would be that the
difference between the two calendar systems will increase by a single day.
Hence if you reckon your birthday in the Coptic/Ethiopic system, that date in
Gregorian may change in five years.  The algorithm here here assumes that
the Coptic/Ethiopic system will follow the 2,000 year rule.

This may however become a moot point when we consider:


=head2 The Impending Calamity at the End of Time

Well, it is more of a major reset.  Recent reports from reliable sources
indicate that every
1,000 years the Coptic/Ethiopic calendar goes thru a major upheaval whereby
the calendar gets resyncronized with either September 1st or possibly
even October 1st.  Accordingly Nehasse would then either end on the 25th
day or Pagumen would be extend to 25 days.  Noone will know their birthday
any more, Christmas or any other date that ever once had meaning.  Chaos
will indeed rule the world.

Unless everyone gets little calendar converting applets running on their wrist
watches, that would rule.  But before you start coding applets for future
embeded systems, lets get this clarified.  Consider that the Gregorian
calendar system is less than 500 years old, so this couldn't have happend
a 1,000 years ago, perhaps with the Julian calendar.  Since the Coptic/Ethiopic
calendar is still in sync with the Coptic, the Copts must have gone thru
the same upheaval.

We are following this story closely, stay tuned to these man pages
for updates as they come in.
