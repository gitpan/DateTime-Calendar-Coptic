About This Release

This is an development release of DateTime::Calendar::Coptic it should
be considered experimental at this time.  Be warned that this package
provides a slightly modified DateTime::Language from DateTime-0.09.

The package will be a work in progress for quite a while.  Expect
internals will to change dramatically as the package matures.  The
intention of DateTime::Calendar::Coptic and DateTime::Calendar::Ethiopic
is to share the same to/from Gregorian conversion class.  It will
take a bit of experimentation to get the packages to play nice together.

Coptic holidays and feasts will be added in future versions.  Verification
of day names is under way.  Much data comes from:
